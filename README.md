## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- See their own IP address and location on the map upon initial page load.
- Search for any IP address or domain and view the key information and location on the map.

## My Process

### Built With

- [pnPM](https://pnpm.io/) - Fast, disk space efficient package manager
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The React Framework for the Web.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework.
- [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) - Used to fetch IP address location details.
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) - A library to generate and render interactive maps.

### What I Learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of:

- Integrating external APIs into a Next.js project and handling dynamic responses.
- Using map libraries like Leaflet.js to implement interactive map features.
- Securing sensitive information (like API keys) with environment variables to prevent accidental exposure in public repositories.
- Leveraging Next.js Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to handle API requests securely and prevent key exposure in network requests.

### Continued Development

Areas I plan to focus on improving include:

- Enhancing **semantics**, **accessibility**, and **SEO** for better usability and visibility.
- Writing **reusable code components** and adhering to **best practices** for maintainability.
- Adding **detailed comments** to improve code readability.
- Experimenting with libraries like [Tailwind Merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) for efficient class management.

### Useful Resources

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Provided detailed guidance on leveraging Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and API routes for secure data handling.
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Helped in designing a responsive and modern UI with utility-first CSS classes.
- [Leaflet.js Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/) - A comprehensive guide for integrating interactive maps and handling geospatial data efficiently.
- [IPify API Documentation](https://geo.ipify.org/) - Essential for understanding the structure and capabilities of the IP Geolocation API used in the project.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Served as a quick reference for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS best practices.
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) - Assisted in troubleshooting issues, integrating Leaflet.js, and optimizing API usage during development.
